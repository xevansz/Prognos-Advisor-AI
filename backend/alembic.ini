# path_separator; This indicates what character is used to split lists of file
# paths, including version_locations and prepend_sys_path within configparser
# files such as alembic.ini.
# The default rendered in new alembic.ini files is "os", which uses os.pathsep
# to provide os-dependent path splitting.
#
# Note that in order to support legacy alembic.ini files, this default does NOT
# take place if path_separator is not present in alembic.ini.  If this
# option is omitted entirely, fallback logic is as follows:
#
# 1. Parsing of the version_locations option falls back to using the legacy
#    "version_path_separator" key, which if absent then falls back to the legacy
#    behavior of splitting on spaces and/or commas.
# 2. Parsing of the prepend_sys_path option falls back to the legacy
#    behavior of splitting on spaces, commas, or colons.
#
# Valid values for path_separator are:
#
# path_separator = :
# path_separator = ;
# path_separator = space
# path_separator = newline
#
# Use os.pathsep. Default configuration used for new projects.

[post_write_hooks]
# post_write_hooks defines scripts or Python functions that are run
# on newly generated revision scripts.  See the documentation for further
# detail and examples

# format using "black" - use the console_scripts runner, against the "black" entrypoint
# hooks = black
# black.type = console_scripts
# black.entrypoint = black
# black.options = -l 79 REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME

# lint with attempts to fix using "ruff" - use the module runner, against the "ruff" module
# hooks = ruff
# ruff.type = module
# ruff.module = ruff
# ruff.options = check --fix REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME

# Alternatively, use the exec runner to execute a binary found on your PATH
# hooks = ruff
# ruff.type = exec
# ruff.executable = ruff
# ruff.options = check --fix REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME

# Logging configuration.  This is also consumed by the user-maintained
# env.py script only.
